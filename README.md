"Pac-Man" is a classic arcade game released in 1980, designed by Toru Iwatani and published by Namco. In the game, players control Pac-Man, a yellow, circular character navigating through a maze. The objective is to eat all the pellets while avoiding ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Eating power pellets temporarily allows Pac-Man to turn the tables and chase ghosts. Fruit bonuses appear periodically for extra points. The game's simple yet challenging gameplay, along with its iconic characters and catchy music, have made it one of the most beloved and enduring video games of all time, influencing countless games and pop culture.
